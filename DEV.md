Reminders for part 03

1.  Can the interface for the utility functions be nicer? (e.g. non-generic)

Future topics
===

1.  Indexed drawing
2.  Instanced drawing
3.  Multiple render (sub-)passes
4.  Multiple vertex buffers
5.  Multiple vertex buffer types
6.  Multiple descriptor sets
7.  Multiple pipelines
8.  Multiple textures/texture array

Notes
===
- Currently locking to gfx 7b7a6353 because part 00 crashes on 6072aedd.
    - Didn't get anywhere with debugging, so if this continues, should file a bug.
